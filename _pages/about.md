I am a PhD candidate in Nanyang Technological University and Alibaba DAMO Academy, supervised by [Asst Prof Shafiq Joty](https://raihanjoty.github.io) and [Dr Bing Lidong](https://lidongbing.github.io).

Before my PhD journey, I graduated from [Information Systems Technology and Design (ISTD)](https://istd.sutd.edu.sg/) at [Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD)](https://www.sutd.edu.sg/),
with a Bachelor of Engineering degree in Artificial Intelligence.
After graduation, I spent one and half year working as a risk and quantitative analyst in a commodity trading house and 
completed a Master of Computing degree at [National University of Singapore (NUS)](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/).
