In this paper, we introduce YEDDA, a
lightweight but efficient and comprehensive open-source tool for text span annotation. YEDDA provides a systematic
solution for text span annotation, ranging from collaborative user annotation to
administrator evaluation and analysis. It
overcomes the low efficiency of traditional
text annotation tools by annotating entities
through both command line and shortcut
keys, which are configurable with custom
labels. YEDDA also gives intelligent recommendations by learning the up-to-date
annotated text. An administrator client
is developed to evaluate annotation quality of multiple annotators and generate detailed comparison report for each annotator pair. Experiments show that the proposed system can reduce the annotation
time by half compared with existing annotation tools. And the annotation time can
be further compressed by 16.47% through
intelligent recommendation.
