Body motion generation aims to generate a simulation of human body motions for a target person’s 3D body structure, based on a continuous motion sequence of a reference person’s 3D body postures. Such technology has been widely used to enhance virtual reality and movie special effects to create characters that are able to mimic human actions. In this task, we assume that the source and target models have the same structure, i.e., the same number of joints. However, the length between two joints can be different.
