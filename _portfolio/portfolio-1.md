The project aims to solve the Know-Your-Customer (KYC) problem by emulating the process which the internet verifies the identity of servers using signed certificates issued by Certificate Authorities. iMMe aims to be a “Validate Once, Verify Everywhere” one stop identity verification service where users would have their identity verified once by us and subsequent identity verification can be done through facial recognition using our app. Customers and Businesses can trust our platform to provide accurate identity verification services akin to how clients trust Certificate Authorities to ensure that the identity and public key of servers are authentic and valid. iMMe offers its services to both businesses and consumers by supporting User-User Authentication, User-Device Authentication and User-Web Authentication.
