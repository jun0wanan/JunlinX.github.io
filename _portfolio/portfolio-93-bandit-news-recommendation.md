Personalized web services are all working towards adapting their services to users through content and user information. Despite having advances in the past few years, personalized web service still remains very challenging. And it is due to 2 reasons; dynamically changing pools of content and the scale of web services that call for fast learning and computational solutions.
The objective of this project is to identify the most appropriate web-based content at the best time for individual users. With a large amount of news and endless content generation online, it is important that we identify content that best fits the interest of online users.
