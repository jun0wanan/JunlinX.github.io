This dataset is created by Serre lab from Brown University. Each of the 52 participants
conducted 10 actions related to breakfast preparation in 18 different kitchens, for each
session, it was recorded by a number of cameras (3 to 5) from different positions. Unlike most existing datasets, those participants conducted those sessions solely by following the receipt without any rehearsal or direction.
The 10 actions are: coffee, orange juice, chocolate milk, tea, bowl of cereals, fried eggs, pancakes, fruit salad, sandwich, scrambled eggs. Each action contains a few subactions, for example, in a coffee preparation action session, 5 sub-actions were
conducted by the participant.
