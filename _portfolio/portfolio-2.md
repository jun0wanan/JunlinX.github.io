This project aims to use mojo FPGA to build a piano game that utilize an octave of a piano keys for the gameplay. Players must press corresponding piano key of the ‘falling’ notes, which is displayed in the screen, in the correct sequences and timing.

The game is based on an alternate version of whack a mole, where the player must follow the musical notes in the correct sequence. This aims to teach the player about how to briefly play the piano, be more alert and train on their hand-eye coordination.
