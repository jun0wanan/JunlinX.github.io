As Singapore’s public housing authority, the Housing & Development Board (HDB) has provided quality and af- fordable public housing for generations of Singaporeans. More than 1 million HDB flats have been developed in 26 towns and 3 estates across the island, being home to over 80% of Singapore’s resident population. The main ob- jective is to predict the housing resale price with higher ac- curacy, enabling both buyers and sellers to make a more in- formed decision with a better understanding of resale mar- ket movement. Second, the importance of each feature in predicting resale price is studied. Besides, from literature review, we found that there was a 60% increase in housing price after the 2008 Global Financial Crisis, followed by a series of strict housing policies to drive the housing price down. The impacts of the economic trend and govern- ment policies is studied.
